## The problem

<!-- > What problem do you want to solve? Why is it a problem? Who does it -->
<!-- > affect? What will solving the problem enable? This section should -->
<!-- > include a brief summary of existing work, such as other packages. If -->
<!-- > you are proposing a change to R itself, you must include a letter of -->
<!-- > support from a member of R core. -->

As technology becomes a part of daily life, it’s more important than ever for educators
to teach digital literacy. Whether they plan on going to college or not, students will need
digital literacy to be successful in their personal and professional lives. As print mediums
begin to die out, the ability to comprehend information found online becomes more and
more important. Students who lack digital literacy skills may soon find themselves at just as
much of a disadvantage as those who cannot read or write. Therefore, Ethiopian universi-
ties need to be encouraged by international research community to position themselves
along with well ranked universities.

One of the biggest challenges in research these days is to ensure that our students and
researchers are equipped with skills to handle the ever increasing size of their datasets
and use technology efficiently to perform reproducible analysis.
The Carentries is a non-profit organization resulting from the merger of Software Carpentry
and Data Carpentry. The Carpentries is a global community of certified instructors, who
have taught workshops that have reached 30,000+ learners in computational literacy for
digital space. Hence, our workshops teach computing and data analytics that covers
foundational coding and data science skills to researchers worldwide.
Both Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry run Workshops to Increase Data Literacy for
Researchers. These workshops are based on Software Carpentry: hands-on, bootcamp
style workshops teaching best practices in Computing, that have demonstrated the suc-
cess of short workshops to teach foundational research skills. Data Carpentry focuses on
data literacy in particular, with the objective of teaching skills to researchers to enable
them to retrieve, view, manipulate, analyze and store their and other’s data in an open
and reproducible way in order to extract knowledge from data.


R is in high demand - an ever increasing number of people from various
domains are keen to learn it and further improve their skills. While
there is an enormous amount of R teaching material, both commercial
and freely available there is arguably a shortage in qualified instructors who possess
skills in **R** and in **effective teaching methodology**. This
shortage of qualified instructors substantially hinders the expansion
of adequate and long-lasting skills in R programming and data science
throughout the community.





The [Software](http://software-carpentry.org/) and
[Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/) organisations develop
and teach workshops on the fundamentals of programming and data skills
needed to conduct research. Their mission is to provide researchers
high-quality training covering the full life cycle of computational
and data-driven research. They strive to *teach researchers in
science, engineering, medicine, and related disciplines the computing
skills they need to get more done in less time and with less pain.*
The quality and success of the Software and Data Carpentry bootcamps
is assured by high-quality, pedagogically sound, collaboratively
developed and openly-available teaching material and **instructors**,
who themselves are trained in effective teaching methodology. This
training is organised by the Software Carpentry itself to assure an
evidence-based and coherent teaching methodology. It has already
organised several instructor training courses which were well attended
and well received, and has accumulated substantial experience
([1](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/09/rebooting-instructor-training.html),
[2](http://software-carpentry.org/blog/2015/12/instructor-training-checkout-procedure.html)).

## The plan

<!-- > How are you going to solve the problem? Include the concrete actions -->
<!-- > you will take and an estimated timeline. What are likely failure -->
<!-- > modes and how will you recover from them? -->

We would like to organise a 2-day in-person
[Data carpentry Carpentry Workshop](https://mesfind.github.io/2019-12-06-DC-DDU/)
that is focused on computational skill with R programming.

The Ethiopian Trainers team are certified member of African Task Force works closely with the Carpentries African Workshop Administrators and the Mentoring Subcommittee to bring these workshops onboard for in Ethiopia.

The exact date, location and list of [participants](https://mesfind.github.io/2019-12-06-DC-DDU/)
will be chosen so as to maximise and diversify participation. We will offer 20-30 places. Participants will be required to demonstrate good knowledge of R and, ideally, to also be familiar with Software and Data Carpentry teaching techniques. We will also ask for a commitment from instructors being trained to go back to their home institutions and deliver a workshop within 6-12 months, so as to maximise the impact of our effort.

The location of the instructor training will be Dembi Dollo University and  Host organisation will need to provide a
room with Projector and a white board or flip chart. The training involves many practical activities where
students are asked to illustrate the course concepts by developing specific examples and exercises related to their language and
domains. In the frame of this course, the programming language would be R and many domains will be relevant to data science in general, and the R community in particular. The R-based outputs of the exercises and assignments will be directly beneficial to R community, as they will be directly applicable to many existing R teaching material, in particular the openly available [Data Carpentry](http://www.datacarpentry.org/R-ecology/) material.

## How can the the DDP help

<!-- > What can we do to help you? If you need money, how much? How will -->
<!-- > you spend it? We expect that most of the budget will be on people, -->
<!-- > but we will consider funding travel and equipment if you have good -->
<!-- > justification. How can we help promote your project? How else could -->
<!-- > we help? -->

We would like to request financial support from the DDP to organise
and promote the course. In addition, we will also benefit from
logistics support from the host university.

## Budget

<!-- > Please note that the budget for the ISC is currently limited. We are -->
<!-- > likely to fund one or two projects with a budget of $20-30k -->
<!-- > projects, and handful of projects with budgets of of $5-10k. We do -->
<!-- > not pay overhead. -->

We request a total of **10k Birr**, including 8K Birr for general training
revenue and 2k Birr travel budget.

## Dissemination

<!-- > How will you ensure that your work is available to the widest number -->
<!-- > of people? What open source license will you use? How will host your -->
<!-- > code so that others can contribute? How will you publicise your -->
<!-- > work? We encourage you to plan at least two blog posts to the R -->
<!-- > consortium blog: once to announce the project, and one to write up -->
<!-- > what you achieved. -->

We will rely on the main R,and Software/Data Carpentry discussion channels to advertise the instructor course. All the course materials (instructor training and R courses) are available CC-BY license; so will any additional material prepared for this R-specific event. The names of the newly trained instructors will be advertised widely for them to further disseminate what they have learned, organise new courses and further promote local instructor communities. We will will broadcast the course and its outcome broadly over social media and through blog posts on the R consortium, Software Carpentry blogs and local communities to (1) foster broad interest and diverse participation and (2) maximise the outcomes for the community in general and the participants themselves.
